After the incident (death of loved one?, death of child?, the man accidently participated in death?), 
the man went to another country to relax from event.

He went on a tour, to see a castle, where he ended up alone. Somehow he ended up deep in castle, and has to escape.
Inside the castle all sorts of weird stuff is happening that are reminders of the incident that is haunting him.

To find the way he has to confront (escape from? capture? solve?) all the monsters.

(idea: The castle can be the reminder of his daughter/son toy castle that she used to play in with the dolls)
(The monsters are sort of doll like)

## Game Play
The main focus of the game is on exploration, survival, and solving puzzles. The gameplay consists of several key components:

• **Puzzles:** To advance, the player must solve various puzzles. Some are logical, while others are time-limited, which also increases the tension. For example, a puzzle involving finding hidden keys and levers.
